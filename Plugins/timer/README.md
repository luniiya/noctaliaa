# Noctaliaa timer

This checkout maintains the installed Timer plugin in `Plugins/timer/`.
Copy its source files to `~/.config/noctaliaa/plugins/timer/` and reload the shell to apply updates; keep the installed `settings.json`.

Modes are ordered Stopwatch, Pomodoro, Countdown, with Stopwatch selected on startup. Reopening the panel preserves the selected mode. Pomodoro repeats 50 minutes of work and 10 minutes of break by default. Edit either duration in its panel or widget settings; this resets the current session but preserves study history. The bar and desktop widget follow the selected mode. The desktop mode button cycles through all three modes.

Only running Pomodoro work time counts toward study history, including partial sessions. Breaks, pauses, countdowns and stopwatches do not count. Switching tabs leaves timers running. History is split at local midnight and saved every 15 seconds, on phase changes, pauses, resets and normal plugin unload. An abrupt crash can lose up to 15 seconds. Elapsed work time during system suspend counts while the timer is running.

Daily data is stored as `studySecondsByDay` in `~/.config/noctaliaa/plugins/timer/settings.json`, with `YYYY-MM-DD` keys and durations in seconds. Export current data and computed stats with:

```sh
qs -c noctaliaa ipc call plugin:timer stats
```

A single stats line shows today's and lifetime focus, streak and XP. Hover it for the full stats, including the best day's duration, days with at least one minute of focus, the current streak, and 10 focus XP per full minute studied. Yesterday's streak remains visible until today gets started. Resetting a timer never deletes history.

Regression tests are in `Tests/tst_pomodoro.qml`; run `Scripts/dev/run-tests.sh -silent` from the repository root.
